    "Tokyo is a city that is booming with people and prospective businesses. There are a lot of workers, tourists and residents who need to eat in the top 5 busiest neighbourhoods in Toyko. It would make sense for a restaurant to open, but we want to know where would be the best neighborhood to open a restaurant through understanding benefits and hinderance of opening a restaurant in these neighborhoods.\n",

    "By looking at busy times during the lunch rush specifically, many people will be wanting to get a decently priced lunch that tastes good. A good profit for a restaurant to make would be about a 20% or above profit. We will be analyzing data from Foursquare and other sources to find which neighbourhood would be the best for the restaurant business."
